Based on past experience from learning multiple skills and some trading resources i think this is kind of a road map for me to become an elite level trader.

## Stage Flow
Newbie → Trainee → Novice → Intermediate → Advanced → Elite

## Quick Reference
- **Newbie**: Learning basics, no live trading
- **Trainee**: [[Process and Daily Routine]] establishment + easy money focus
- **Novice**: Playbook creation + small risk + formal routine
- **Intermediate**: Scaling + psychology + routine becomes habit
- **Advanced**: Size pushing + adaptation + routine optimization
- **Elite**: Flow state + holistic optimization + peak routine

## Supporting Systems Throughout
- [[Constant Learning]] - Continuous improvement at every stage
- [[Process and Daily Routine]] - Evolves with each stage
- [[Ultra Learning]] - Accelerates progression between stages
