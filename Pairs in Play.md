A pair in play refers to a currency that has heightened potential for opportunity on a given day due to specific catalysts or conditions. Itâ€™s the instrument you want to prioritize because it offers cleaner, more predictable setups. It's like going to a casino and instead of playing 21 go and sit behind a broken slot machine.

## Definition
Forex pairs that have:
1. **Fresh news catalysts**
	+ Economic data releases (e.g., CPI, NFP, interest rates)
	- Major geopolitical event
	- Etc.
2. **Exceptional technical patterns**
3. **Massive volume trading**
	+ Significantly higher trading volume than average
	- Strong momentum across multiple timeframes
4. **Relative Strength or Weakness**
	+ Outperforming or underperforming related pairs
	- Sharp divergences from correlated assets

## Why This Matters
Asset selection is 60% of the edge itself (that number is intuitional :) )
