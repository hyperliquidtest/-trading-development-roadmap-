## Process Definition
"Another name for routine" - A systematic series of steps designed to achieve consistent outcomes by removing guesswork and emotion through repeatable frameworks with feedback loops and its refinements.
or specifically for trading i can say:
systematic and repeatable set of actions, routines and mental frameworks that a trader uses to consistently identify, execute, manage and review trades.

## <span style = "color : red">Why Process is Everything </span>
- Success comes from faster improvement rates, not better strategies
- Systematic approach eliminates emotional decision-making
- Creates competitive advantage through refinement speed
- Builds consistency in all market conditions
- Compounding skills become exponential over time
- Knowing where you are and where you are going

## Daily Routine Framework
Still don't have a routine working on it and waiting for the Mr.Jamshidis sessions to become something out of habit . but i just know the entire sat and sun is for reviewing and learning new stuff.
for now just building a process and bringing order out of chaos. till the next month (June 2025) it should be completed.

## Stage-Specific Routine Evolution
### [[Stage 2 - Trainee]]: Process Development
- Establish basic daily routine
- Focus on consistency over complexity
- Build trade/chart database
- **Ignore P&L completely**

### [[Stage 3 - Novice]]: Routine Solidification  
- Formal [[Daily Report Card]] implementation
- Systematic trade journaling
- Regular playbook updates
- Risk management integration

### [[Stage 4 - Intermediate]]: Process as Habit
- Routine becomes automatic
- Monthly performance reviews
- Advanced data analysis
- Psychology integration

### [[Stage 5 - Advanced]] and [[Stage 6 - Elite]]: Optimization
- Peak performance protocols
- Holistic routine (sleep, diet, exercise)
- Advanced psychological preparation
- Continuous refinement focus

## Hard Work vs. Process Balance
"If you pause for some weeks to build a process is much better to just do hard work"
- Action trumps perfect planning
- Consistent effort with basic process > perfect process with inconsistent effort
- Build routine through repetition, not extensive planning

## Routine Optimization Principles
- Start simple, evolve complexity gradually
- Focus on consistency over perfection
- Regular refinement based on results
- Integration with [[Constant Learning]]

## Success Metrics
- **Daily**: Process adherence, not P&L
- **Weekly**: Learning objectives met
- **Monthly**: Routine effectiveness analysis
- **Quarterly**: Major process upgrades
