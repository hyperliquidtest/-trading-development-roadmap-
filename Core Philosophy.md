## <span style="color:red">Trading Essence</span> 
I see the essence of trading as a dance of these 3 major things:
- **Bet sizing** based on the best estimation of expected value
- **Market psychology** deep understanding 
- **Understanding** technical analysis at a level very few out there do

## <span style="color:red">Key Principle of My Trading Career</span> 
+ **[[Process and Daily Routine]] And [[Constant Learning]] >>> Everything Else**
- Edge > Risk Management > Psychology 
- Improvement speed > Trading strategies
- Systematic framework removes emotion
- The measure of success every day is to answer this question not P&L
	- Did i learn anything new today? How can i implement my new learning as fast and efficient as possible into my trading?
- The Strategic Questions should be answered on a daily, weekly and monthly basis they are the fuel for the map and actionable step plans for [[Process and Daily Routine]]
- [[Pairs in Play]] are crucial. they are the backbones of any edge and they are information in the black see noise of markets

## <span style="color:red">Strategic Questions (Daily, Weekly, Monthly Review)</span> 
These are the questions that i will build my whole trading career around them:
- What are the easiest ways to make money?
- What are the fastest ways to study those opportunities?
- How do I build daily processes for these actions?

## Foundation Systems
- [[Process and Daily Routine]] - The systematic framework
- [[Constant Learning]] - The improvement engine
- [[Ultra Learning]] - The optimization method
