From my experience and ongoing research, I've found that all edge development in discretionary trading is achieved through a finite set of methods. While the types of edge are infinite, the methods to develop them are not.


## Four Methods

### 1. [[Observation Method]]
Low commitment, slow results

### 2. [[Hypothesis Formation Method]]
High creativity required, solid hit rates

### 3. [[Reverse Engineering Method]]
Most powerful, systematic approach

### 4. [[Copy a Master Method]]
Highest hit rate, hardest to access


## A rule of thumb
From the developing the edge until the time of trading it. always apply it to just [[Pairs in Play]]
